# **🌑⚡ SOLSTICE LABS ⚡🌑**  
*(We commit at midnight. We deploy at dawn. Sleep is a myth.)*

## **🚀 WELCOME TO THE LAB**  
A secret society of developers, chaos engineers, and nocturnal code warlocks. We specialize in:  
- **Spaghetti that compiles** *(somehow)*  
- **Production fires** *(that we start on purpose)*  
- **Git histories** *(that tell horror stories)*  

**Warning:** Our CI/CD pipeline runs on caffeine and hubris.
